# So you're starting a Ruby on Rails project at Flatiron School

## Introduction and Objectives

The last few weeks of the Flatiron Ruby semester includes a project mode where students get to work on building real applications. The goal of this period is to expose students to actual problems that arise when building and teach them how to manage a project. The goal of the projects is not to launch a massively popular social network or startup, but rather, just to learn.

    Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.
    - Oscar Wilde

While we love teaching you all the things about programming, in the end, we're trying to build things, and that isn't something we believe can be taught, but rather, must be learned by trying and failing and exploring.

So make sure you are keeping your eye on learning, a constant balance between building and shipping and learning.

During project mode, our expectation of you is that you ship at least 2 small projects.

## Working in Teams

During project mode we want you working in teams of 2 to 3 people. Do not work alone, that is absolutely not allowed, and do not work in teams bigger than 3, they are hard to manage and add a people layer of complexity to the project.

We believe that as professionals, you should be able to, in fact take pride in your ability to, work with anyone. Work with people more advanced and less advanced and figure out how to be productive in both situations. Work with people that share your interests and people with wildly diverse backgrounds and figure out how to leverage all perspectives. 

So who you work with shouldn't matter, but it does. Try to pick people that share your goals of learning and your values as a developer, the pace and hours you want to keep and the technologies you want to learn, and the problem you are looking to solve. It should be fun.

# Picking a Project

Building something usable is tremendously hard. There are a few things we've learned over the years about building.

1. Everything is harder than it sounds. You'd be surprised how quickly complexity grows. Be humble about your estimates and somewhat realistic about what you can accomplish.
2. Keep it simple! Seriously, embrace constraints. Make your project as small as possible while still capable of delivering the majority of the value. Maybe you don't need a User registration system that supports 10 external OAuth providers, maybe you don't need to allow them to reset their passwords (do you even have users complaining about this?), maybe exporting to PDF is enough and you don't need to support epub and kindle. Just keep it simple. 1 version of something is more than enough. Think Minimum Loveable Project. 

Beginners have a tendency of choosing very hard projects, pick a project that you can imagine having a somewhat working version of after a day. Keep it simple and small.

We love projects that utilize external APIs and Data Sources. They make everything more interesting.

- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)
- [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com)

In terms of what projects are cool, we tend to think the nature of value in software lies in being able to answer or automate a question that was previously difficult. For example, Airbnb answers the questions "Who's couch can I crash on tonight?", Kickstarter "Where can I get money for an art project?" (or conversely, "Which independent projects can I support?"). Your application, every feature, should answer a person's question. For instance, an application you could build might answer "Who is committing code at Flatiron School right now?", "Who wants to meet for tutoring this weekend?". Focus on questions, on problems, then solve them with code. Your application should answer at most 2-3 fundemental questions.

# Starting Your Project

Clone from the Flatiron [Template]()
Setup external services (API's, etc.)
Get a base layout done
deploy a homepage

# Planning and Working on Your Project

3. Iterate! Stay fast and small. Build things in small parts. You should be able to launch a new feature every day because you build in the smallest possible unit and are constantly driving toward deploying a new piece of code. Don't pile up requirements, look for shortcuts, look for ways of having a 'good enough' version of the feature and not all the bells and whistles.
4. Make videos
